1. Types of send:
	1.1 Fire and forget: don't care about the answer
	1.2 Sync: wait for the answer
	1.3 Async : doesn't wait but has callback
2. Record Metadata: partition, offset, timestamp, key/value size and topic
3. Apache Kafka preserves the order of messages within a partition.This means that if messages were sent from the producer in a specific order, 
the broker will write them to a partition in that order and all consumers will read them in that order. For some use cases,order is very important,
some use cases are less sensitive.Setting the retries parameter to nonzero and the max.in.flights.requests.per.session to more than one means
that it is possible that the broker will fail to write the first batch of messages, succeed to write the second (which was already inflight),
and then retry the first batch and succeed, thereby reversing the order.Usually, setting the number of retries to zero is not an option in a reliable
system, so if guaranteeing order is critical, we recommend setting in.flight.requests.per.session=1 to make sure that while a batch of messages is 
retrying, additional messages will not be sent (because this has the potential to reverse the correct order).This will severely limit the throughput 
of the producer, so only use this when order is important.
4. In the case of null key, round robin algo puts the records into respective partitions
